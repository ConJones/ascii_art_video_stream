# ascii_art_video_stream

This is a project I did in college for real time systems, a python code sends a greyscale image to a microcontroller which convert it to an ascii image and sets it back via UART. It is meant to replicate a video steam which is one of the most common real time systems we interact with on a daily basis. This a huge oversimplification of what actually goes on behind the scenes when you turn on Netflix, but it was a fun project.
